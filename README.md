## Spider app - to learn more about TypeScript in practice.

### it’s really just Hangman, but less inappropriate since you draw a spider hanging from its web rather than a human.

#### Our requirements are as follows:

- A person playing the game can enter a word or phrase to be guessed
- Text cannot be seen as it’s typed
- Letters of the word/phrase to guess are displayed as blanks (underscores) until guessed
- Other characters in the word/phrase (e.g. spaces, apostrophes, etc.) are displayed
- Letters to guess (all letters of the alphabet) are displayed on screen as buttons
- Clicking a correct letter disables the button and displays the letter in the word/phrase
- Clicking an incorrect letter disables the button and displays incorrect indicator
- Structure from which the spider will hang is displayed on screen
- With each incorrect guess another part of the body is filled in: abdomen, cephalothorax, individual legs
- Game can be reset at any point
